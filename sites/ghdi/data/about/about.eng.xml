                    <hi rendition="#i">German History in Documents and Images</hi> (GHDI) is an
                    online collection of primary-source materials documenting various aspects of
                    German history from the Early Modern period to the present. The project consists
                    of ten chronologically ordered volumes, each of which features a large selection
                    of carefully chosen texts and images, as well as maps and audiovisual sources in
                    some cases. Each volume also includes an introduction to the featured period as
                    well as other commentaries. The website is completely bilingual
                    (English/German). Designed to serve broad audiences, GHDI aims to promote new
                    approaches to research, academic teaching, and learning in the fields of German,
                    European, and transnational history. </p>

                    and technical metadata, including granular source and rights information,
                    enhances discoverability and supports long-term digital stewardship. The use of
                    standard format such as TEI P5 (for primary-source texts and translations) and
                    DOI (persistent identifications) further supports access and digital
