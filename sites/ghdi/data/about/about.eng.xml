				    <hi rendition="#i">German History in Documents and Images (GHDI)</hi> is a comprehensive collection of original historical materials documenting German history from the beginning of the early modern period to the present. GHDI is an initiative of the German Historical Institute, Washington DC. Made possible by the generous support of the Max Kade Foundation and the ZEIT-Stiftung Ebelin und Gerd Bucerius, the project has been undertaken in cooperation with the Friends of the German Historical Institute, the Bildarchiv Preußischer Kulturbesitz and the IEG-MAPS, Institute of European History, Mainz. In August 2017, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) awarded the GHI a generous grant in support of the relaunch of the portal.

				<p>
				    The project comprises ten volumes, each of which addresses a discrete period in Germany's history. Each volume has been compiled by leading scholars and includes:
				</p>
			    <list>
			        <item>an introduction to key developments in Germany's social, political, and cultural history during the period;</item>
			        <item>
			            a selection of primary source documents (in German and English) as well as image originating from the period;			            
			        </item>
			        <item>
			            a selection of relevant maps.			            
			        </item>
			    </list>
				    
				<p>	    
				    Each volume addresses the following subjects: Government and Administration; Parties and Organizations; Military and War; Economy and Labor; Nature and Environment; Gender, Family, and Generations; Region, City, and Countryside; Religion; Literature, Art, and Music; Elite and Popular
				    Cultures; and Science and Education.
				</p>
			    <p>				    
				    All of the materials can be accessed through keyword, subject, and author searches. Advanced options also allow searches to be limited and refined. 
				</p>
			    <p>
			        Many of the documents included in this project are difficult to locate in print publications, especially outside of Germany. All of the German-language documents included in GHDI are accompanied by contemporary English translations, almost all of which were commissioned for the project. GHDI also offers new access to a range of historically significant visual images, many of which will be unfamiliar to viewers.

				<head>Digital Platform and Design</head>
				<p>
					<hi rendition="#i">GHDI</hi> features a responsive, user-friendly interface designed by edelweiss* büro für grafik und design (Hamburg). The backend is based on the integration of eXist-db, an open-source XML-database, with Collective Access, an open-source collection management system. A Solr search engine offers optimal search and navigational functionality. Standardized administrative, descriptive and technical metadata, including granular source and rights information, enhances discoverability and supports long-term digital stewardship. The use of standard format such as TEI P5 (for primary-source texts and translations) and DOI (persistent identifications) further supports access and digital preservation.
